# Tox is a generic virtualenv management and test command line tool. Its goal is to
# standardize testing in Python. We will be using it extensively in this course.

# Using Tox we can (on multiple operating systems):
# + Eliminate PYTHONPATH challenges when running scripts/tests
# + Eliminate virtualenv setup confusion
# + Streamline steps such as model training, model publishing
